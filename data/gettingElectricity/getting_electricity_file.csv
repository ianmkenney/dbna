See Page 44+ for Commercial Building Procedures.

Step 1) Establish Account and Request Service.
Notes: Can be completed in-person, telephone, mail, or facsimile. Therefore considering 1-day procedure. Required cost is basic service charge, believe that means Cost of Electricity (US Cents per Kilowatt-Hour times 20,000). Opinions team?

Step 2) Design Distribution System.
Notes: NES Customer Engineering will design the layout for the business. If anything like residential, this process takes 6-8 weeks. Hard to track down the official cost, but will continue to look.

Step 3) Install Meter Base and Other Service Equipment
Notes: Lots of rules in this step. No information on cost or time here, but will continue to look.

Step 4) Site Preparation for Overhead Service
Notes: There is a ton of variance here. Essentially it's up to the land-owner to trim and remove trees so there is no interference for power lines. We have no choice but to assume the land plot is barren (no trees), so nothing to worry about here.

Step 5) Install Service Mast
Notes: Takes roughly $1,500 and roughly 5 days to install.

Time to find procedure, time and cost information: Roughly 1 hour. Definitely takes some searching to find the right resources!
