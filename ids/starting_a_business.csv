Procedures: 6
1. Registering the business as an LLC. This has two advantages:
-Increased credibility
-Protection from personal liability in the event your business is sued
2. Obtaining a federal tax ID number (FEIN or EIN) with the IRS after you have confirmation and filed articles from the State of Idaho showing your approved Idaho business. An EIN is used to identify a business in its federal tax filings. Without an EIN, you can't hire employees or open a business bank account.
3. Registering for Idaho taxes:
-Sales Taxes
-Employment Insurance Taxes
-Withholding Taxes
4. Opening a business account
5. Obtaining Permits and Licenses
6. Getting Insured

Paid-In Minimum Capital as a Percent of Income per Capita- 0
There is no capital requirement in any part of the United States. These laws have been retracted for market-incentive alternatives.
""The United States, for instance, once imposed significant requirements on how much capital had to be contributed and maintained in a corporation. But those rules have lost virtually all of their value for stockholders and creditors because better approaches have been developed.""

Requirements for starting a business in the City of Jacksonville
1.The City levy’s a Local Business Tax (FORMERLY OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE) for the
privilege of doing business in Jacksonville/ Duval County (in accordance with
Florida Statutes, CH. 205). Local Business Tax Receipts are valid for one year,
starting October 1st and expiring September 30th of the following year. Receipts
not renewed by September 30th are delinquent and subject to applicable
penalties. Additionally, any person who does not pay the required Local Business
Tax within 150 days after the initial notice of tax due, and who does not obtain
the required Local Business Tax Receipt is subject to civil actions and penalties.
Any person doing business in Jacksonville/ Duval County must obtain a Local
Business Tax Receipt. Any businesses located in another municipality in Duval
County are required to obtain a city Business Tax Receipt from that municipality
where the business is located, in addition to paying the county tax for Duval
County. Any person who provides merchandise, entertainment, or services to the
public, even if only a one-person company or home-based business, must obtain
a Local Business Tax Receipt before starting to operate.
http://www.coj.net/departments/tax-collector/local-business-tax.aspx
2. A COU will need to be filed for through the Zoning Department.
http://www.coj.net/departments/planning-and-development/developmentservices-division/zoning-section.aspx
3. A Building permit for a ""tenant improvement"" or ""tenant build out"" may be
required if it is determined by the Building or Fire Marshall’s Office that a Change
in the application of the code has occurred in the building or structure being
considered for occupancy. This would be determined during the evaluation of the
Zoning COU using ""previous use"" and ""previous permitted work"" as a guide. If a
Building permit is determined to be necessary it would require employing a
Licensed Contractor to pull the permit and acquiring the services of a Licensed
Design Professional to produce plans for ""tenant improvement"" or ""tenant build
out"".

I'm going to try to figure out which procedures can be done simultaneously. For example, we need to determine whether they can do the ""Assess your business"" procedure (step 3)) while ""applying for a sales tax permit"" (step 4) is also underway. That way, instead of 28-30 days, it would still just be 20 (or 21 since we can't start two procedures on the same day).

Great work though! These definitely appear to take longer, and I'll keep that in mind. Awesome job though!
