None
The Labour Standards Code says that an employee with 10 years or more of service cannot be fired or suspended without good reason or just cause. What is good reason will depend on the employee’s and employer’s circumstances.
To show that the employer had good reason, he/she may have to show all of the following:
the employer has made their expectations clear to the employee
the employer has warned the employee to change behaviour
the employer has given the employee a reasonable chance to change behaviour
the employer has warned the employee that not improving behaviour could lead to
being fired
